# EnchanTest - testing software automagically

EnchanTest helps you get the most out of your software specification and testing effort. It is a framework for checking and testing that software behaves the way you want; without requiring you to repeatedly give input or take decisions. Ideally you should specify and judge only once what is the expected behavior and EnchanTest should automate the rest. EnchanTest itself is implemented in a variety of technologies, mainly Ruby (for gluing things together) and R (for statistics and machine learning) and Javascript (for the web-based front-end), but with specific plugins it can be used to test many types of software.
